Secondly, I'll introduce you something about my present major and post-graduate period plan. I major in information system and management. The courses I have taken include JAVA, SQL, WEB and so on. On the one hand, I develop solid basic subject capabilities in these courses. On the other hand, these courses of tool category stimulate my strong curiosity about data science. During my post-graduate time, I'd like to study data excavating furtherly. At the same time, I hope to overlook some frontier scenery in this field and practice my paper-writing skill with my tutor.
Finally, thanks for our college's cultivation, I'll continue to study diligently in the new period. Thank you! </div>
